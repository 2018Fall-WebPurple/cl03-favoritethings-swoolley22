    I have been going to Eagles games since I was born. my family has had season tickets since Lincoln Fiancial Field was built. The Eagles games are considered a family gathering for us, we all enjoy it. We have been with the Eagles through thick and thin and it was very rewarding to see them succeed.</figcaption>
